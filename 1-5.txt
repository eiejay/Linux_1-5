How to check running processes:
ps
ps aux | less
ps -ef | less shows parent process id (PPID)
ps -lax | less shows Nice value etc

Managing jobs

In case of of a running process in a loop like the following shell script:

(while true; do echo "Hello" >> ~/hello.out; sleep 5; done)\> &

To call the running jobs:
Commands:

jobs --> Gets the running jobs
fg 1 "(1) The running job number. Brings the job 1 to the foreground. 
ctrl + c kills th e job
bg 1 
ps j | grep "15652" This lists all running jobs and greps the process id "15625"

Terminate running processes with kill and Pkill commands
kill -l  --> lists all the kill commands
kill -SIGTERM %(Job number) or kill -15 %1 or kill -SIGTERM 12232 (PID)
kill -SIGSTOP %1 (1) job number
kill -SIGCONT %1 --> used to start a job number
kill -9 (PID)  or Kill -SIGKILL (PID) --> Terminates a process immediately 

Installing apache web server
yum install httpd
yum status httpd
yum enable httpd
yum start httpd
yum stop httpd

pgrep httpd -l --> shows the running processes with apache webserver

pkill httpd --> kills all apache "httpd"

pgrep -u username -l --> lists all the processes ran by the user 'username'
pgrep - username -l top --> kills the a specific process 'top' ran by the user - 'username'


pgrep -v -u root -l --> lists all processes not run by the user 'root'. 

w --> checks all logged in users in the system
pkill -t 'tty name' or pkill -9 -9 'tty name' -- this kicks out the user with the associated ttyname'


CHECKING PROCESSES

uptime
cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep "processor" | wc -l --> counts the number of processors in the system   
yes > /dev/null & --> The ampersand causes the command to run in the background. The yes command causes a load on the memory bc it loops untill stopped by pressing 'ctrl + c'


top -d -2 --> The top command quits after two minutes
top -n -2 --> The Top commands shows two frames before quitting.


ADJUSTING THE PROCESS PRIOROTY WITH RENICE.

nice -10 yes > /dev/null --> sets a process priority for 'yes' command
renice -n -5 (PID)--> changes the nice value or the process priority of a process.
 

USING PROCSYS AND SYSCTL TO MODIFY OR SET KERNEL RUNTIME PARAMETERS

This makes the configuration persistent.

cd /proc/sys/kernels

cat hostname
ls -l --> checks permisions of files
(When you find rw permisions on the owner, then you can modify the file)
sysctl -a | grep kernel

Check file persissions of a thread/file
ls -l threads-max --> didplays a value, to modify the value...
sysctl -w kernel threads-max=(type the new value you want to set)
 or 
echo "newValue" > /proc/sys/kernel/threads-max --> This does not make it persistent
nano  /etc/sysctl.conf

enter: kernel.threads-max = newValue --> save and reboot.

PRODUCE AND DELIVER RESULT ON SYSTEM UTILIZATION.
yum install sysstat -y
nano /etc/sysconfig/sysstat --> His tory can be modified here.
cd /var/log/sa
ls
sa25
cat sa25 -->unreadable 
sadf -d /var/log/sa/sa25 -- -u -r -dp -n DEV --> command that makes it readable.
