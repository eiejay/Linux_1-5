SYNCHRONIZING FILES AND FOLDERS SECURELY BETWEEN SYSTEMS
RSYSC copy changes only
rsync -av /root/document /tmp/     

-v is verbose. Lets us see what is going on
-a is archive mode. It enables -r, which synchronizes recursively the whole directory
                               -l,			symbolic links
				-p			preserves files permissions
				-t			preserves time stamps		
				-D	synchronizez device files
				-o      preserves owner permisions
				-g        "       group    "

        
 rsync -av /root/Documents/ /tmp/Documents/    --> the "/" at he the end of documents means copy or sync the directory without recreating the directory. This was omited in the first command.  
  
SYNCHRONIZING BETWEEN TWO MACHINUSING SSH

rsync -av root@192.168.1.2:/var/log /tmp This sync files from a remote machine to our temp directory. 

It could be the other way round... 

From our local machine to a remote machine

rsync -av /var/log root@192.168.2.3:/tmp
